1)I created this file in my local repository.
2)Then I used "git add ."(to add all files)
3)I could have also used (git add ivan-1)
Then I checked the status of files by
"git status".
4)As after "git add", I again modified ivan-1 file, hence it showed this file in both stage area and untracked(files not in stage, area) area.
5)Now I again performed "git add" command, and now there are no untracked files.
6) Now I did a commit operation.
"git commit -m "Ivan-1 file was created""
7) Then I checked my commit status using
"git log" command(showing time of commit, previous commit and sha code).
8) Everything looks good, so I wanted to push it into a new branch.
9) So I wrote "git push -b ivan".
10)Task completed.
